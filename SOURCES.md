## Archival Research Notes

This sources list represents a comprehensive compilation of materials related to the Charlie No-Face/Green Man legend and Raymond Robinson's life. Sources range from primary historical documents to contemporary internet discussions, reflecting the legend's evolution from local knowledge to global awareness.

### Source Evaluation Considerations:

**Primary sources** (birth records, death certificates, contemporary newspaper accounts, first-hand interviews) provide the most reliable information about Robinson's actual life.

**Secondary sources** (books, documentaries, academic analyses) offer interpretation and context but should be evaluated for accuracy and bias.

**Tertiary sources** (internet forums, social media, some websites) are least reliable for facts but valuable for understanding how the legend spreads and evolves.

**Oral history** presents special challenges, as memories change over time and stories blend fact with elaboration. Multiple accounts should be compared when possible.

### Research Gaps:

Despite extensive documentation, some aspects of Robinson's life remain incompletely documented:
- Detailed daily activities and routines
- Personal writings or recorded statements by Robinson himself
- Complete medical records and treatment history
- Comprehensive list of all locations he frequented
- Full accounting of media coverage during his lifetime

Researchers should approach this topic with both scholarly rigor and human sensitivity, remembering that Raymond Robinson was a real person whose story deserves respectful treatment.

---

**Note on Access:** Some sources, particularly archival materials, family documents, and medical records, may have restricted access due to privacy concerns, archival policies, or preservation requirements. Researchers should contact relevant institutions for permission and access procedures.

**Note on Attribution:** When using information from these sources, proper citation is essential. Personal testimonies and family accounts should be used with particular care to respect privacy and dignity.

**Note on Updates:** This sources list reflects knowledge as of 2026-01-14. New sources continue to emerge as interest in the legend persists and as digitization makes historical materials more accessible. Researchers are encouraged to seek updated materials and newly available sources.
